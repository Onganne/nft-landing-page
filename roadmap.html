        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">PHASE 0</h2>
        <h4>The Beginning of the Tweeting (Present)</h4>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">This will be focusing on the growth of social media accounts, specifically Twitter. Tweets, shares, and posts to most of these social media accounts will be divided into posts of promoting the product by going into detail of the product's background and utility, by reviewing the tools and techniques used to produce the product (which includes reviewing the product itself and having a behind the scenes), and by asking for opinions to improve the product or increase variety of it. This is all to create a community, but of course the community must have somewhere to go, we need to lead them, which is going to be towards a discord channel at first, then a website. Creating a website takes priority, to give the viewers a more in-debt description of our product and a countdown timer. A discord server will be made after the website, this is to give them regular exclusive updates of the progress of our product. Meaning, what will be posted here will be both social media stuff and bonus content, like a drawing time lapse, how you draw, special events, and even thank you messages.</p>

      <div class="timeline__content"><img class="timeline__img" src="images\boxes\OpenSeaLogo.png"/>
        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">PHASE 0.5</h2>
        <h4> Let's Start Sailing in the OpenSea (In a few days)</h4>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">The first product to be released will be the Souless Scrubs NFT Collection, focusing on the Scrubs' random collection and drawing. It will be done on OpenSea due to the no gas-fee payment by using Polygon. However, this will be focusing on my product only, as OpenSea is too wide of a competition and also only fits the Souless Sketches type of NFT design, which is focusing more on utility rather than design. The special discord areas will have content about comparing our ratings to our competition and rating them as is. Our special page in the website will have the discord link and special page, also including an email list for them to have special offers notified via email.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">PHASE 1</h2>
        <h4>The Bear Market Adoption (In a few weeks)</h4>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">During the NFT Bear Market, the Scrubs will be massively marketed and advertised for “adoption”. During this phase, this will test to see if people are willing to buy these “scrubs” NFT for the chance to earn something better in the future through the future phases, and in the present through utility, which comes in forms of getting alpha information, more access to the roadmap, more info to the team, upgradability of the scrub NFT, and exclusive offers following the roadmap.

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">PHASE 2</h2>
        <h4>WEYU! Let the TFTs Rise with Souless Cycles (In a month)</h4>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">First, note that we are trying to transfer to Weyu instead of Opensea. Second, note that this will happen once the NFT economy will be out of the bear market. They will also be changed to TFTs, with more info in Discord. The new TFT project will include a new collection with new art styles and new utility! They are named the Souless Cycles, with a deeper meaning behind this art style and element in the art itself, meaning it's upgrading the art with better utility than the first. Collaborations will then be made in an attempt to gather more awareness, with NFT featuring articles, like NFT Times and NFT Calendar.</p>

        <h4>Domain Extension, through Collaborations! (Around a month)</h4>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Focusing on mass Collaborations, the main goal is to gather more exposure in the product. Collaborating with more influencers, featuring articles, and reviewers will allow for this exposure to further develop the audience and community. This will allow us to be mentioned by them. Though this only focuses on exposure, collaborations for exclusive products and materials for the audience will also be considered. These collaborations include finding deals from businesses’ products, influencers’ merch, and freelancer’s services we can help with. Merging communities with other communities of our target audience will also be permitted. Collective projects that could be worked on with the collaborator can also be planned and benefit both communities.</p>

        <h4>Regret and Chicken (In around 2-3 months from now, now being 18/3/2022)</h4>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">********, a chicken parmesan focused business that sells….chicken parmesan, with cheese! We will be collaborating with this food industry to provide for our staff and possibly for our community! Through giveaways and discounts for the community and buyers of the Souless Cycles TFT and Souless Scrubs NFT holder only. This is also a limited offer that will only start at the middle of June until the end of September. A TFT of the industry’s mascot will also be made, where whoever owns that will get to order the food once for free, as well as participate in all future giveaways and exclusive rewards.

        <h4>The Souless Souls (In around 5-6 months from now, being 18/3/2022)</h4>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Cool yet deadly looking ghosts that looked like they have lost their souls. Meant to resemble the Souless Cycles TFT if one has a such a TFT. Meaning the NFT can be personalized to match the TFT of that person if he/she owns a Souless Cycle TFT.</p>

        <h4>3rd Times the Charm, or regret it (Focuses 5-12 months from now, now being 18/3/2022)</h4>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Anyone who has this Souless Souls NFT will get access to an exclusive alpha game collating with us from another studio. Though they are relatively new to the space of game development, they have experience on story making, character design, and some programming.</p>

        <h4>Souless Snails (Pixelated), Small and Slow (In around 10 months from now, now being 18/3/2022)</h4>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">This will be a side project for people who prefer cheaper NFTs who still want to join the community and get the benefits of other NFTs. Buying this will also permit giveaways for the Souless Sleepers and Souless Souls NFTs.

        <h4> The Souless Sleepers (In around 10-15 months from now, now being 18/3/2022)</h4>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">The Souless Sleepers NFTs are meant to be released during late 2022, where the unique thing is that once the New Year of 2023 comes it will result in them waking up in a cheerful way. This is meant to give people to have the happy positive vibes.</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">
          Connecting to other special collaborators, mainly the ones the creators of the Souless NFTs know about, giving more exclusive content and info.

        <h4>Bold and Beyond (In around 5 years from now, now being 18/3/2022)</h4>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">After 5 years and beyond, more NFT cycles (collections) will release to further give content to the community that supported us. Better improvements overall will be made like expanding sales availability to allow minting with no gas fees via personal websites, better artstyle and possibly hiring people from the community to help as well, a visual comic will be made (it’s a personal goal mostly) to give the NFTs more personality, and more collaborations for better exclusive games, info, and content. Helping the environment and causes of good will also be prioritized by us to hopefully give back of what we earned as our gratitude.

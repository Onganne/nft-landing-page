            <p>Truth to be told, we are Junior Entrepreneurs who are interested in the NFT marketplace. 
              Though we are new to the space, the team has a junior marketing chief, multiple artists, and an animator.
            </p>
            <p>We strive into making multiple different NFT collections with either artistic elements, utility element, or both these elements in a creative flow different from others. Knowing this, we also attempt to use or NFT for a good cause, either through donations of earnings to causes (like the adoption childcare, check roadmap) or through giving valuable info and materials to consumers.</p>

        <h2>Scrubs born'd Bottom</h2>

        <p>The bear market is where the Souless Scrubs begin at, at the very bottom of the bottom. Needing to be cared for, they thoughtlessly offered themselves to become forever framed as an NFT. These are caused by the continuous hardships of being an artist, trying their hardest to make a living, but to no avail. Now, will you be able to adopt and raise them to become the better versions of themselves through caring for them via special means? Or will you at least show them the value of themselves through trading them as valuable? Or…will you leave them behind to be eventually deleted via their contract with me?</p>

        <h3>Why help buy them? Who'd benefit?</h3>

        <p></p>
        <p>Having them will also allow you access to exclusive giveaways, beta projects and information, tips and secrets for artistic design and NFT business, possibilities for interviews, and supporting us in helping the orphans and orphamages' hardships</p>
        
        <h4>Intorducing the Healthcare!</h4>

        <p>They have done an average of 200 events per year ever since 2006. U! Happy has partnered with individuals, companies, and other groups to aid their own programs that have benefitted over 100 organizations focused on children around Metro Manila.</p>

        <h3>The Details</h3>

        <p>Cycle 0: The Souless Scrubs…These NFTs can be upgraded….these scrubs can be helped to become better…or worse...characters. Helping these scrubs to upgrade gives them a completely more unique look HAND DRAWN from our artists again, not generated. To help them to become better from their scrub selves, you need to successfully let them understand being in a community, which is done by engaging and being noticed by the marketer manager in all three social media platforms and discord to start. After, you need to continue this trend for as long as possible, and eventually (in 1-5 weeks) you will be called for an exclusive offer personally requested by Souless. Finally, just follow what Souless wants to request of you to upgrade (clue: it is about info for the next cycle of NFTs).</p>

        <p>Available in OpenSea and soon in this website! Smart Contracts help developed by HashLips and OpenSea, while the art has been made hand drawn by our team, which means it can be upgradable when the time comes</p>
